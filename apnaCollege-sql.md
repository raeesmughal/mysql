## database
a collection of data in a format that can be easily accessed (Digital)
example : 
- A customer management system that stores names, emails, and phone numbers of clients in tables.

## Data Base Management System (DBMS)
A software application used to manage our DB is called DBMS

- Oracle
- Microsoft SQL Server
- MongoDB

these are examples of DBMS


## Relational Database 
A Relational Database stores data in tables (also known as relations), where each row is a record and each column is an attribute. It uses SQL (Structured Query Language) to manage and query the data.


## Non-Relational Database (NoSQL)
A Non-Relational Database stores data in formats other than tables such as key-value pairs, documents, graphs, or wide-columns. It is often used for large-scale, unstructured, or rapidly changing data.
