## âœ… MySQL â€“ Summary
MySQL is a Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) that uses SQL (Structured Query Language) to manage and manipulate data.

- ðŸ”¹ Type: SQL-based DBMS

- ðŸ”¹ Model: Relational (data is organized in rows and columns using tables)

- ðŸ”¹ Purpose: Used to create, read, update, and delete structured data

- ðŸ”¹ Language Used: SQL

- ðŸ”¹ Open-source: Yes (widely used and community-supported)

- ðŸ”¹ Popular For: Web applications, enterprise solutions, data analysis

#### In simple terms:

<i>MySQL is a database management system where we use SQL to create and manage relational databases efficiently.</i>





## database
a collection of data in a format that can be easily accessed (Digital)
example : 
- A customer management system that stores names, emails, and phone numbers of clients in tables.

## Data Base Management System (DBMS)
A software application used to manage our DB is called DBMS
examples : 
- MySQL (it uses SQL 'structured Query Language')
- Oracle
- Microsoft SQL Server
- MongoDB

these are examples of DBMS


## Relational Database 
A Relational Database stores data in tables (also known as relations), where each row is a record and each column is an attribute. It uses SQL (Structured Query Language) to manage and query the data.


## Non-Relational Database (NoSQL)
A Non-Relational Database stores data in formats other than tables such as key-value pairs, documents, graphs, or wide-columns. It is often used for large-scale, unstructured, or rapidly changing data.





# âœ… SQL â€“ Structured Query Language
SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standard programming language used to communicate with relational databases. It allows you to perform tasks like creating databases and tables, inserting, updating, retrieving, and deleting data.

(used to perform CRUD operations)

## database structure
if we have created a database, how we can imagine to structure it? 

we can think it like we have a database where we have multiple tables to store ```INTER RELATED``` for example, one table is created to store students data and another table in the same database is used to store management staff data (if you are building for school)

## âœ… What is a Table?
A table in a database is a structured collection of rows and columns, used to store related data in a relational format.

ðŸ”¹ Columns (Vertical): Define the structure or schema of the table â€” they specify what type of data will be stored, such as roll_no, name, class, dob, etc.

<i>Think of columns as fields or attributes.</i>

ðŸ”¹ Rows (Horizontal): Contain the actual data entries for each record. Each row is a unique data item that fills in values for all the columns.

<i>Think of rows as records or individual entries.</i>

<u>In short: A ```table``` defines the structure (via columns) and holds data (via rows).</u>
